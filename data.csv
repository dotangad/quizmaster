1,"The etymology of this sneaky practice begins in 1996: <br />
High-ranked players Geoff Frazier and Greg Boyko ran into a problem on Warcraft II’s primitive online servers. Due to their fame, many gamers would simply disconnect or refuse to play if they were matched for a game. <br />
To counter this (and to troll some novices), the two began playing under new cartoon-y aliases — Papa X and X-ette respectively — to mask their identity. <br />
Dubbed X-ing, the practice quickly spread through Warcraft II and broader gaming world. Today, X-ing falls into a grey area of gaming, with some like Fortnite even handing out bans to users caught X-ing. ",,Smurfing,,,
2,"A <string>linter</string> is a program that ensures code quality by policing poor style practices and other suspicious behavior.<br />
An example is X, a code-analyzer that judges <strong>Ruby</strong> code. Its job is to enforce the community Ruby Style Guide by reporting and fixing rule-breaking syntax.<br />
In 2020, its punny name attracted controversy for alleged insensitivity amidst America’s political climate. In turn, the developer argued that these protestors had missed the point of the sci-fi film which lent its name to X: fighting corruption, not glorifying systemic violence.<br />
What is X? Give funda for the controversy.

4,"Victorian logician Augustus de Morgan is famous for many things - his laws of boolean logic, and being the tutor of Ada Lovelace. Seemingly, though, he also had a knack for poetry, as expressed by:<br /><br />

“Great fleas Have Lesser Fleas,<br />
upon Their backs To Bite’em,<br />
And Lesser Fleas Have Lesser fleas,<br />
And So, Ad infinitum.<br />
and Those great Fleas, Themselves, In turn<br />
Have Greater Fleas To go On;<br />
while Those Again have Greater still,<br />
And greater Still, And So on.”<br />
What concept does the poem illustrate well?",,"Recursion

5,"This long-ongoing “X vs Y” spelling debate can be traced back to Sir Humphry Davy.<br />
Davy was the first to coin the name X from the common oxide, but the name didn’t end up being terribly popular. The British scientific community ignored Davy’s coinage, as it was inconsistent with Davy’s previous discoveries and didn’t sound Latin enough. Instead, they began using Y.<br />
Across the Atlantic, Noah Webster was responsible for X’s prevalence in the USA. Later, this spelling would be cemented by American industrialists who preferred X for its resemblance to another prestigious metal.<br />
ID X & Y. ",,Aluminum vs Aluminium,,,
6,"This specific term originates from the name of a vessel used by the commanding officer of naval ships. These officers were characteristically designated, by custom, to fly a cloth over the ship board to distinguish it from other ships. These vessels were usually the strongest or fastest in the entire fleet, and today, this term has traveled over years to connote a similar meaning in technology products, where companies often use it to refer to their highest profile or most expensive offering.<br /><br />

What term?",,Flagship,,,
7,"The tech blog GameByte recently came across an interesting phenomenon in the UK. The UK government has been attempting to deal with the Omicron variant’s resurgence through increased testing, and one of the ways people can receive their test results is through QR codes sent to their emails. However, for many people, the QR code actually, and very ironically, opens a particular app on their phones. There are many hypothesized reasons behind this, like similarities in the internal codename of the QR code, but regardless, this arguably hilarious coincidence is leading to a lot of confusion amongst the affected users.<br /><br /> 

What app?",,Plague Inc.,,,
8,"In July 2021, a California-based state agency and the SEC filed a lawsuit against X for ignoring workplace harassment reports, and gender bias, attacking the “frat boy” culture of the company and accusing leadership of inaction. This led the company into months of controversy, jeopardising its relationship with many of its partners.<br />
A significant comment was made by the new CEO of Y’s gaming division two weeks ago, when he said that Y was “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions, and evaluating all aspects of our relationship with X.”<br />
Ironically, Y’s solution to all this mess is simple - the acquisition of X, which continues to push Y as a behemoth in gaming.

Y - Microsoft",,,

<strong>The Key</strong> was originally announced with the above tagline as an April Fool’s joke by the website X as their first venture into hardware.<br />
